# Personal website
This is my personal website's code! I first made and published it in 2008. I've made small updates to it ever since, but recently since I've been in a software engineering class, I've started to become familiar with GitHub, and have been making more structural updates and optimizations for HTML 5.

Deploying online with new improvements:
* Increased readibility with larger font size and line height
* Removed depreciated &lt;center&gt; tags and replaced &lt;table&gt; elements with flexbox containers
* Updated old/dead links and cleaned up links to outside sources
* Created media queries for iframes and fitting content to new margins
* Optimized styling for all possible screens, horizontal or vertical

## Future goals
* Replace social media icons with SVG images
* Left-align video player iframes, or fit width to margins without creating vertical space between descriptive text
